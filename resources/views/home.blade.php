<h1>About me</h1>

<p class="TextSize"> My name is Jarod Wylie and I have lived in Lexington for the past 6 years learning 
    different skills such as woodworking and making the perfect cup of coffee. During these years I have fallen in love with Lexington and taking on challenging problems.
 In my search to learn more I have begun a career in web development and have joined Awesome Inc Web Development Bootcamp.</p>
